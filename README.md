# YOLOv8 Object Detection
This project demonstrates the use of the YOLOv8 model for object detection. The notebook includes steps for dataset preparation, visualization, and model setup using the ultralytics library. The dataset used in this project has been manually annotated for high-quality training and evaluation.

## Features
### Dataset Management:
Unzips and organizes custom datasets for training and evaluation.
#### Manual Annotation:
The dataset used for training has been meticulously annotated to ensure accuracy.
### Visualization:
Displays annotated bounding boxes on randomly selected images for validation.
### YOLOv8 Setup:
Installs and initializes the YOLOv8 library for training and inference.
